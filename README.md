Simple app with login and success scren.

## Setup

Project uses build runner to generate files.
Before running app, build with
```
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Architecture
 I was following some principles of Domain-Driven Desing, although this project is very simple and does not required this approach.
